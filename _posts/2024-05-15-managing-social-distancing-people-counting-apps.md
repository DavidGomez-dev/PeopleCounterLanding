# Managing Social Distancing with People Counting Apps

In today's world, managing social distancing is more critical than ever. With the COVID-19 pandemic still a concern in many regions, businesses and public spaces must ensure that they are taking appropriate measures to maintain safe distances between individuals. This is where people counting apps come into play, offering an effective way to monitor and manage the flow of people in real time.

## What are People Counting Apps?

People counting apps are digital tools designed to track the number of individuals entering and exiting a particular space.
