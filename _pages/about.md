Counterpeople is an app for Count people in your events in amazing real time with your phone, no need for old hand tallies or other devices.

Share the event easily with other gatekeepers so you can monitor different gates (entrances or exits) at real time, cooperative and synchronized, knowing always the actual number of people inside.

It works in choppy or slow cellular areas or even offline (updating on server when back online)
